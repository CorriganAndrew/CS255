DriverPass Project Overview
The DriverPass project was developed to help a client manage the entire process of scheduling, overseeing, and tracking driving lessons. The main goal was to make it easy for users to book or adjust lessons, monitor their progress, and securely pay online. Meanwhile, administrators needed to manage user accounts, generate reports, and stay in line with DMV regulations.

What I Did Well
I felt particularly comfortable handling the written parts of the project, such as creating business requirements and clearly presenting the system’s goals. This strength in written communication made it easier to keep everything organized and ensure the design would meet the client’s needs. It also helped convey ideas effectively to both technical and nontechnical stakeholders.

Potential Revisions
If I could do one thing differently, I’d take another pass at the use case and sequence diagrams. My diagram skills aren’t as strong, and simplifying some of the overly technical details would make those visuals more approachable for everyone involved.

Interpreting User Needs
To figure out exactly what users needed, I spent time reviewing the business requirements document and the interview transcripts. By focusing on core goals like easy scheduling, secure payments, and comprehensive progress tracking, I ensured the system’s design directly addressed real-world needs. Keeping user perspectives front and center is always crucial for delivering a final product that’s both intuitive and impactful.

Approach to Software Design
My software design process involved mapping out user needs, translating them into use cases, and then representing them visually using UML diagrams. Going forward, I plan to deepen my understanding of the intricacies of UML design to improve clarity and precision. Techniques like user story mapping and prototyping will also help maintain a user-centered and adaptable design.
